### Complete Vagrant Training

<br>

This repository contains all the steps and notes/documentation about my YouTube videos on Vagrant, from my channel "Synergists".

<br>

In my videos, I cover everything from the basics of Vagrant to more advanced topics like provisioning and managing multiple Vagrant boxes. I also include demos and examples to help you learn how to use Vagrant in real-world scenarios.

### Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and run the following command:

`vagrant up`

This will start a new Vagrant box with all the necessary software installed. You can then access the Vagrant box using SSH:

`vagrant ssh`

Once you're logged in to the Vagrant box, you can start learning about Vagrant by following the steps in my videos.
